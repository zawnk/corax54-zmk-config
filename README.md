# Firmware for Splitkeyboard

This is the [ZMK](https://zmk.dev/) firmware for the [Corax](https://github.com/dnlbauer/corax-keyboard) keyboard.

Optimised for US international keymap.

## Keymap

This layout is compatible with the 56 and 54 key version of the corax keyboard.
For the 54 key version (Corax54), the outer pinky row is simply ignored by the keyboard.
